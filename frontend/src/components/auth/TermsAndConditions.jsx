              <p>
                Game Trail uses AI (Groq API) to validate your code and generate challenges.
                AI responses are evaluated automatically and may not always be perfect.
                Results are intended for learning and may occasionally require manual review.
                We are not liable for any inaccuracies in AI-generated feedback.

                value. They cannot be transferred, sold, or exchanged for real currency.
                We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the rewards system
                at any time without prior notice.

                compete fairly and honestly. Any attempt to manipulate room sessions,
                exploit game mechanics, or disrupt other players' experience may result in
                account suspension.
